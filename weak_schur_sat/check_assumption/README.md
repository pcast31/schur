# Step 1
Every WS 4 partition of 1..65 verifies m_4 >= 23 and m_3 = 9

# Step 2
Find every subset in which an integer in a :
- WS 4 partition of 1..65 (stored in possibilities/4.txt)
- WS 5 partition of 1..185 with m_5 >= 66 (stored in possibilities/4.txt)

# Step 3
Verify that there are no WS 6 partition of 1..583 with :
- m_5 >= 66
- m_6 >= 186
- 210..349 in the 6th subset
