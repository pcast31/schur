# Parallel Algorithms for Weak-Schur Numbers 

This repo aims to provide code using simulated annealing (and potentially other genetic algorithms) to compute weakly sum-free partitions, over multiple processes and in parallel. The upshot is that there are also reasonably fast functions which verify partitions and compute the fitness score of a given potential partition, which are completely implemented in `numpy` for speed.

The proposal for the algorithm, and its motivations, have been detailed in [Algorithm Proposal](WeakSchurAlgorithmProposal.pdf). 

[WeakSchur](src/README.md) contains the explanation for the main code in greater detail.

## `verify_partition` and `fitness `

Both algorithms are based on the same method of generating all unique pairs of numbers in a given color partition; the idea is to generate a `meshgrid` of all possible pairs, and then get the (strictly) upper triangular part of the returned matrices of `meshgrid`: say `xx` and `yy`. The performance of this implementation of `verify_partition` is as follows.

In each case, the X-axis represents the total number of iterations used by `timeit`, and the time is in seconds. As expected, the total time taken is linear in the number of iterations, but time taken per iteration remains fairly constant. 

`fitness` simply counts the number of pairs `a,b,c` such that they violate the sum-free property of the partition i.e. `a+b=c` for distinct `a,b,c`. Since the code isn't too different, the performance is not expected to be very different either. The specific times (in seconds) are in the following table.

## `algorithm`

<!-- The idea of this algorithm is to be simple, and parallellizable. The steps are as follows:

- **Step 1** Select the numbers to allocate in this round - usually, this is a list of `n` consecutive integers, and send them to the Process.
- **Step 2** The process will add one integer to each of the `n` partitions, and compute the fitness of each.
- **Step 3** Once the results have been computed, the solutions are chosen in some manner, in this case, with `SimulatedAnnealing`.  -->

The idea of this algorithm is to be simple, and parallellizable. The steps are as follows:
- **Step 1** Get the number to add for the current iteration
- **Step 2** Sequentially add it to each subset in the partition, and evaluate the fitness 
- **Step 3** Choose the solution that has the minimum fitness, or according to a choice algorithm like SimulatedAnnealing.
