\section{Introduction}

\qquad We are interested in partioning the set of integers \(\{1, ..., p\}\) into \(n\) subsets such that there is no 
subset containing three integers \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) verifying \(x + y = z\). We say these subsets are 
\textit{sum-free}. If we add the hypothesis \(x \neq y\), we say the subsets are \textit{weakly sum-free}. The 
greatest \(p\) for which there exists a partition into \(n\) sum-free subsets is called the \(n^{\text{th}}\) Schur 
number and is denoted \(S(n)\) \cite{Schur1917}. Likewise for weakly sum-free partitions we define \(\WS(n)\) 
the \(n^{\text{th}}\) weak Schur number \cite{Irving1973}. Only the first values of these sequences are known. 
In this study, we improve the lower bounds on these numbers.


\subsection{State of the art}

\qquad Before Rowley's "template"-based approach for Schur and Ramsey numbers \cite{RowleyRamsey}, the 
previous generic construction for Schur numbers was given by Abbott and Hanson \cite{AbbottHanson} in 1972 
with a recursive construction. It used to give the best lower bounds for all sufficiently large numbers. No equivalent 
was known for weak Schur numbers and as a result the best known partitions for large weak Schur numbers 
did not use the weakly sum-free hypothesis. 

\par
As for smaller weak Schur numbers, the best lower bounds were obtained by conducting a computer search. Eliahou 
\cite{EliahouBook}, Bouzy \cite{Bouzy2015AnAP} and Rafilipojaona \cite{Rafilipojaona} improved the lower 
bounds with Monte-Carlo methods. This was the main approach during the past decade. This search for weakly 
sum-free partitions relied on the recursive assumption that a good weakly sum-free partition into \(n+1\) subsets 
starts with a good weakly sum-free partition into \(n\) subsets. 

\par
In 2020, Rowley introduced the notion of templates for Schur and Ramsey numbers \cite{RowleyRamsey} which 
generalizes Abbott and Hanson's construction and produces new lower bounds (and inequalties) for Schur numbers. 
He also provides two inequalities for weak Schur numbers \cite{RowleyWS} that yield significant improvements 
over previous lower bounds, and besides do utilize the \textit{weakly} sum-free hypothesis.

\subsection{Structure of this article}

\qquad Our main contribution is a generalization of the concept of template to weak Schur numbers. 
Our templates provide new lower bounds (and inequalities) for weak Schur numbers. This construction also includes, 
as a special case, a construction similar to Abbott and Hanson's \cite{AbbottHanson}, but this time with 
\textit{weak} Schur numbers.

\par
In the \hyperref[Schur]{section 2}, we explain Rowley's template-based construction in the context of 
Schur numbers. Then, we give new templates, thus providing new lowers bounds and inequalities as well as 
showing that the growth rates for both Schur and Ramsey numbers \(R_n(3)\) exceed 3.28. 

\par
Then, in the \hyperref[WeakSchur]{section 3}, we generalize the concept of templates to weak Schur numbers 
and provide new lower bounds for weak Schur numbers. 

\par
We now introduce notations and definitions we use throughout this article.

\subsection{Definitions and notations}

\qquad We start by defining sum-free and weakly sum-free subsets to introduce regular and weak Schur numbers.

\begin{definition}
A subset \(A\) of \(\mathbb{N}\) is said to be \textit{sum-free} if
\[ \forall (a,b) \in A^2 \text{, } a+b \notin A\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A subset \(B\) of \(\mathbb{N}\) is said to be \textit{weakly sum-free} if
\[ \forall (a,b) \in B^2 \text{, } a \neq b \Longrightarrow a+b \notin B\]
\end{definition}

Let us notice that a sum-free subset is also weakly sum-free, hence justifying the name of \textit{weakly} sum-free
subsets. Given \(p\) and \(n\) two integers, we are interested in partitioning the set of integers \(\{1, 2, ..., p\}\), 
denoted by \([\![1,p]\!]\), into \(n\) (weakly) sum-free subsets.

\par
Schur proved in \cite{Schur1917} that given a number of subsets \(n\), there exists a value of \(p\)
such that there exists no partition of \([\![1,q]\!]\) into \(n\) sum-free subsets for any \(q \geqslant p\). A similar
property holds for weakly sum-free subsets \cite{Irving1973}. These observations lead to the following definitions.

\begin{definition}
Let \(n \in \mathbb{N}^*\). There exists a greatest integer denoted by \(S(n)\) (\textit{resp. \(\WS (n)\)}) such that
\([\![1,S(n)]\!]\) (resp. \([\![1, \WS (n)]\!]\)) can be partitioned into \(n\) sum-free subsets (resp. weakly sum-free
subsets). \(S(n)\) is called the \textit{\(n\)\textsuperscript{th} Schur number} and \textit{\(\WS (n)\) the
\(n\)\textsuperscript{th} weak Schur number}.
\end{definition}

Given a partition of \([\![1, p]\!]\) into \(n\) subsets, we generally denote these subsets \(A_1, ..., A_n\). We also denote
\(m_i = \min(A_i)\). By ordering the subsets, we mean assuming that \(m_1 < ... < m_n\). However, if not specified we do 
not make this hypothesis since we do not always consider partitions in which every subset plays a symmetric role.

\begin{definition}
We sometimes refer to a partitition as a coloring. The coloring associated to a partition \(A_1, ..., A_n\) of 
\([\![1, p]\!]\) is the function \(f\) such that \(\forall x \in [\![1, p]\!], x \in A_{f(x)}\). Likewise, the partition associated to
a coloring \(f\) of \([\![1, p]\!]\) with \(n\) colors is \(\forall c \in [\![1, n]\!], A_c = f^{-1}(c)\).
\end{definition}
