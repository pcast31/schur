\section{Introduction}

\qquad We are interested in partioning the set of integers \(\{1, ..., p\}\) in \(n\) subsets such that there is no 
subset containing three integers \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) verifying \(x + y = z\). We say these subsets are 
\textit{sum-free}. If we add the hypothesis \(x \neq y\), we say the subsets are \textit{weakly sum-free}. The 
greatest \(p\) for which there exists a partition into \(n\) sum-free subsets is called the \(n^{\text{th}}\) Schur 
number and is denoted \(S(n)\) \cite{Schur1917}. Likewise for weakly sum-free partitions we define \(\WS(n)\) 
the \(n^{\text{th}}\) weak Schur number \cite{Irving1973}. Only the first values of these sequences are known. 
This article focuses on the lower bounds for these numbers.

\par
Before Rowley's "template"-based approach for Schur and Ramsey numbers \cite{RowleyRamsey}, the 
previous generic construction for Schur numbers was given by Abbott and Hanson \cite{AbbottHanson} in 1972 
with a recursive construction. It used to give the best lower bounds for all sufficiently large numbers. No equivalent 
was known for weak Schur numbers and as a result the best known partitions for large weak Schur numbers 
did not utilize the weakly sum-free hypothesis. As for smaller numbers, the best lower bounds were obtained 
by conducting a computer search. This search for weakly sum-free partitions relied on the recursive assumption 
that a good weakly sum-free partition into \(n+1\) colors starts with a good weakly sum-free partition into \(n\) 
colors. In 2020, Rowley introduced the notion of template for Schur and Ramsey numbers which generalizes 
Abbott and Hanson's construction and gives new lower bounds (and inequalties) for Schur numbers. Rowley also 
gives two inequalities for weak Schur numbers \cite{RowleyWS} that yield significant improvements over previous 
lower bounds which besides do utilize the \textit{weakly} sum-free hypothesis.

The main contribution of this article is a generalization of the concept of template to weak Schur numbers. 
This gives new lower bounds (and inequalities) for weak Schur numbers. This construction also includes as a 
special case an analogous for weak Schur numbers of Abbott and Hanson's construction for Schur numbers.

\par
We first explain Rowley's template-based construction in the context of Schur numbers and then give 
new templates, thus providing new lowers bounds and inequalities as well as showing that the growth rates 
for both Schur and Ramsey numbers \(R_n(3)\) exceed 3.28. 

\par
We then  generalize the concept of templates to weak Schur numbers and provide new lower bounds for weak 
Schur numbers. 

\par
Finally, we analyze the significant difference between new lower bounds obtain with templates and the former 
lower bounds obtained by computer search and we provide evidence which indicate that the main assumption 
made in those articles removes the optimal partitions from the search space.

\par
We now introduce notations and definitions we use throughout this article.

\begin{notation}
We denote by \([\![1,p]\!]\) the set of integers \(\{1, 2, ..., p\}\).
\end{notation}

\begin{notation}
For a partition of \([\![1, p]\!]\) in \(n\) subsets, we generally denote these subsets \(A_1, ..., A_n\). We 
also denote \(m_i = \min(A_i)\).
By ordering the subsets, we mean assuming that \(m_1 < ... < m_n\). However, if not specified we do not 
make this hypothesis since we do not always consider partitions in which every subset plays a symmetric role.
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}
A partitition is sometimes referred to as a colouring. The colouring associated to a partition \(A_1, ..., A_n\) of
\([\![1, p]\!]\) is the function \(f\) such that \(\forall x \in [\![1, p]\!], x \in A_{f(x)}\). Likewise, the partition 
associated to a colouring \(f\) of \([\![1, p]\!]\) with \(n\) colors is \(\forall c \in [\![1, n]\!], A_c = f^{-1}(c)\).
\end{definition}
