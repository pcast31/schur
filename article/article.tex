\begin{abstract}

This article provides new lower bounds for both Schur and weak Schur numbers. These results were obtained by 
continuing on Rowley's "template"-based approach for Schur and Ramsey numbers. Finding templates allows us to 
get explicit partitions improving lower bounds as well as the growth rate for both Schur numbers and Ramsey 
numbers \(R_n(3)\). We also developed a new method to improve lower bounds for weak Schur numbers. 
Furthermore, this paper tries to analyze former works on weak Schur numbers based on the principle that good 
partitions into \(n+1\) weakly sum-free subsets start with a good partition into \(n\) weakly sum-free subsets. 
We show that exceeding the previous lower bound \(\WS (6) \geqslant 582\) is impossible with such an assumption 
upon imposing certain conditions on the good 5-subsets partitions. The new lower bounds include 
\(S(9) \geqslant 17\,803\), \(S(10) \geqslant 60\,948\), \(\WS (9) \geqslant 22\,536\) and 
\(\WS (10) \geqslant 71\,214 \).

\section{Conclusions and future work}

\qquad These new results come from an extension of Rowley's template-based approach for Ramsey graphs and 
Schur numbers which is relatively new. Therefore, we will not be surprised if lower bounds are later improved 
using better templates. Moreover, studying specifically \(S^+(n)\) and \(\WS^+(n)\) might be of interest as they
 are closely related to Schur and weak Schur numbers. In order to find new templates, algorithms based on 
randomness such as Monte-Carlo algorithms may prove to be very useful. This could be the subject of a future work.

\par
The fourth section gives new insight on the method that was formerly used to achieve new lower bounds for weak 
Schur numbers. The assumption behind it might have removed the optimal partitions from the search space and thus 
lowered the highest value that can be reached within it. However, the methods used to explore this search space 
are efficient as the optimum was found. Thereby Monte-Carlo algorithms may prove to be very useful if used in a 
search space with more potential. Finding a weakly sum-free partition which is better than previous lower bounds 
and which is not as regular as those obtained with templates would be extremely interesting (even if it does not 
improve current lower bounds) since it could suggest a new search space which could then be explored with the 
above mentioned methods.
