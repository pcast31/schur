\begin{abstract}

This article provides new lower bounds for both Schur and weak Schur numbers. These results were obtained by continuing on
Rowley's "template"-based approach for Schur and Ramsey numbers. Finding suitable templates allows us to apply Rowley's construction
to get explicit partitions improving lower bounds as well as the growth rate of both Schur numbers and Ramsey numbers \(R_n(3)\).
We also developed a new method to improve lower bounds on weak Schur numbers. Furthermore, this paper tries to analyze former
works on the subject based on the principle that good partitions into \(n+1\) subsets start with good partitions
into \(n\) subsets. We show that exceeding the previous lower bound \(\WS (6) \geqslant 582\) is impossible with such an assumption upon
imposing certain conditions on the good 5-subsets partition. The new lower bounds include \(S(9) \geqslant 17803\), \(S(10) \geqslant 60948\),
\(\WS (9) \geqslant 22536 \) and \(\WS (10) \geqslant 71214 \).

\section{Conclusions and future work}

\par
These new results come from an extension of Rowley's template-based approach for Ramsey graphs and Schur numbers which is relatively new.
Therefore, we would not be surprised if lower bounds are later improved using better templates. Moreover, studying specifically \(S^+(n)\) and
\(\WS^+(n)\) might be of interest as they are closely related to Schur and weak Schur numbers.

\par
The fourth section gives new insight on the method that was formerly used to achieve new lower bounds for weak Schur numbers. The assumption behind it
might have removed the optimal partitions from the search space and thus lowered the highest value that can be reached within it.
However, algorithms based on randomness such as Monte-Carlo algorithms may prove to be very useful if used in a search space with more
potential. For instance, such an algorithm could be used to find better templates and improve inequalities and lower bounds for high values
of \(n\). This could be the subject of a future work.


\section{Acknowledgments}

\par
We would first like to thank our professors, Joanna Tomasik and Arpad Rimmel, who guided and advised
us during the whole research and writing. Last but not least, we would like to address warm thanks
to Fred Rowley who kindly answered our many questions and with who it was a pleasure to exchange.
