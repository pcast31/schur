\section{Conclusions and future work}

\par
These new results come from Rowley's approach for Ramsey graphs which is relatively new. Therefore, it would not surprise us
if lower bounds are later improved using better templates. Moreover, studying specifically \(S_+(n)\) and \(WS_+(n)\) numbers might be
of interest as they are closely related to Schur and weak Schur numbers.

\par
The fifth section gives new insight on the method that was formerly used to achieve new lower bounds. The principle behind it
might have discarded many interesting partititions of the search space and lowered the highest value that can be reached within it.
However, algorithms based on randomness such as Monte-Carlo algorithms may appear very useful if used in a search space with more
potential. For example, such an algorithm could be used to find better templates and improve inequalities and lower bounds for high values
of \(n\). This could be the subject fo a future work. Nevertheless, it would not help for the smallest values.

\section{Acknowledgments}

\par
We would first like to address warm thanks to Fred Rowley who kindly answered our many questions and with who it was a pleasure
to exchange. A great thank-you to Marijn Heule who also took the time to respond to our requests. Finally, last but not least, we would
like to thank our professors, Joanna Tomasik and Arpad Rimmel, who guided and advised us during the whole research and writing.
